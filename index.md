## Introduction

<img src="assets/images/me.jpg" alt="Photo" hspace="20" width="30%" align="right"/> Hi, you curious enough to find yourself reading my introduction, and welcome! My name is Riku, I'm a 24-year-old student at the University of Helsinki majoring in general linguistics. Apart from my morbid language fascination, I'm interested in music and hiking; I play the bass and the harmonica, and I try to regularly venture into the Finnish wilderness to spend a night or to "in the bush", as they'd say in New Zealand.

## Find me on

[Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/rigutchin/) & [GitHub](https://github.com/rguttesen), but don't bother.

## Contact

You can contact me through: riku.guttesen@helsinki.fi, or, if you still haven't entered the 21st century (good choice by the way), you can find me in Mets√§talo on Tuesdays from 12-14 in front of lecture hall 4 where I'll be studying Italian.
